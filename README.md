https://peer2peer-enterprise.org:2443/ 


# Backend 
Deno based backend

# Frontend
Vue.js

# Values & Spirit
Shall be built in the spirit of Web3  
1. high degree of decentralization (e.g. deployed as permaapp via arweaveapps)  
2. high degre of interoperability (e.g. via linked data - [the solid approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy5eKqM8-OA))  
3. high cohesion and loose coupling of modules  

# Background to Values and Spirit
Re-building the decentralized web - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy5eKqM8-OA 
 
# Options / Ideas
1. Use the [Community.xyz P2P Token](https://community.xyz/#vyDjA2UggLj12tcFR-lKAo1kKaZyNeAM2twEJ62xkco/tokens) as currency --> current owners will be available during the Hackathon and will hopefully be happy to share their stakes :) 
2. Deploy and use a new ERC20 Token as currency
3. Use Fiat Money - connected via old school payment solutions like PayPal etc. - for the people living in non-crypto countries
